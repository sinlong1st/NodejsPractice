+ Modules
+ Module Wrapper function

Install nodemon:

+ In package.json, put this in the "scripts" object: "devStart": "nodemon server.js" (server.js is the Server file we are coding on, change it depends on your server file name)
+ npm run devStart => run all the code in the server.js and when ever you modify the file, it would automatically reload it => save lots of time
